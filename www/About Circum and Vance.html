    <h1>About Circum and Vance</h1>
    <p>Circum and Vance is a new company in the state of Maine. We are currently filing to be the only active hedge fund in the state. Circum and Vance has three members on the board of executives. Our Executives are Matthew Anthony, Evan Sokup, and George Hagi. Evan resides in a coastal Maine town while Matt is established in Massachusetts and George lives in Connecticut. By having our board be diversified, we bring different perspectives to the table. Massachusetts and Connecticut are both home to some large and very profitable companies. Having connections with large companies allows us to be able to negotiate ways to lure companies to a new location.</p>
