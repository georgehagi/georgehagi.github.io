<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>Circum and Vance is a company with a simple goal, to build up Maine. Maine is a state that does not have many large businesses. Our mission is to bring in large companies and thus more people. By doing this, we predict a boom in the states overall economy. Maine's unemployment rate is nudge higher than its surrounding states and with this economy booster, it will help contribute to an even lower unemployment rate.</p>
